# Police-Firearm-Discharge
Data Visualization Project for Police Firearm Discharge

Police Shootings have been a very controversial topic in recent years. Every now and then we are witnessing police shootings across the United States, especially for the last few years. We have lost thousands of peopleâ€™s lives in police altercation, and some victims were shot or killed with no valid reasons.

We decided to name our project Police Firearm Discharge, and the project is inspired by the police altercations that happened with George Floyd back in 2020. Our goal and motivation behind this project is to raise awareness of police abuse of power.
